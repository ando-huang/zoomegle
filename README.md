# Zoomegle

DATE: March 21st, 2020
Pretty much all base functionality has been implemented, probably okay for soft launch

Zoomegle is intended to be a collaborative education website for anyone interested in college level courses.

Started on March 18th, 2020, Zoomegle was created as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which forced many college students to return
home for the semester, with classes to be held on Zoom. Most lectures are recorded for those who could not make the lecture time, and 
Zoomegle aims to help those whose schedules do not align with their university's due to relocations or other circumstances.

Feel free to add features or other resources as you see fit, this project is meant to push education forward in these difficult times.

Stay safe all!
